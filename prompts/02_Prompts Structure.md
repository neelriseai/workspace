Prompt Structure and Execution Order

Source of truth:
- Always align every prompt with `prompts/01_Master_Design_for_xpath_healer.md`.
- If any prompt conflicts with master design, master design wins.

Required prompt files (layer-wise)

Execution order

1. `tasks/create_structure.md`
2. `phases/core_healing.md`
3. `phases/unit_tests.md`
4. `phases/playwright_integration.md`
5. `phases/database_layer.md`
6. `phases/service_layer.md`
7. `phases/model_layer.md`
8. `phases/configuration_stage_policy.md`
9. `phases/observability_reporting.md`
10. `tasks/add_tests.md`
11. `tasks/refactor_review.md`
12. `tasks/runbook_validation.md`

Authoring rules for all prompt files

1. Keep prompts implementation-oriented, not generic theory.
2. Include exact module and method names from current repo.
3. Include acceptance criteria and "done" checks.
4. Include commands for validation (`python -m pytest ...`).
5. Include constraints to prevent unrelated refactors.
6. Keep secrets in env vars only (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `XH_PG_DSN`).
7. Preserve stage names and order used by healing traces.
