   - service/
   - tests/{unit,integration}
   - prompts/{architecture,phases,tasks}
   - artifacts/{logs,reports,screenshots,videos,metadata}
2. Create missing directories/files only when absent.
3. Add placeholder modules only if needed to complete architecture.
4. Do not modify business logic files in this step.

Output required:
- Missing items list.
- Patch/commands applied.
- Final tree snapshot.
```

Done criteria:
- All architecture folders exist.
- Prompt packs exist for architecture/phases/tasks.
- No unrelated source refactor performed.
